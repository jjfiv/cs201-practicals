# cs201-practicals
Workspace / Practicals Starter Code for CS201@Midd S2022

## About

This repository contains configuration for VSCode, Java, and starter code for the various practical assignments that we'll be doing in CS201 for Spring 2022.

## Getting Started

 - Make sure you've [installed Java & VSCode](https://jjfiv.github.io/cs201-s2022/install.html).
 - Install git
     - ***MacOS:*** open terminal, type ``git --version``; installer should launch or version should print.
         - If that's giving you an error, and not an installer, you can type ``xcode-select --install`` instead to get Apple's Developer Tools.
         - If that takes forever to download or you don't have enough disk space, you can pursue a "just git" installer here: [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) "Binary Installer"
             - The developer of that installer has not registered with Apple, so when you go to open the installer, you'll have to override the security check by doing Right-Click > Open on it.
     - ***Windows:***: Get git-for-windows [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
         - Ask questions about the installer via Slack/lab.
 - (Only Once!) Use VSCode to clone:
     1. Open Action Search: ``Ctrl-Shift-P``
     2. Search for ``Git: Clone`` action.
         - If not present, try quitting VSCode and opening it again (it may not have this option if git was not installed when it was launched).
     4. Provide repository url: 
         - ``https://github.com/jjfiv/cs201-practicals.git``
     6. Select repository location from that menu (choose carefully; sometimes hard to move!)
     7. Open new window.
 - (When there's new practicals) Use VSCode to pull.
     1. Open Action Search: ``Ctrl-Shift-P``
     2. Search for and invoke ``Git: Pull`` action.
